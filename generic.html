									<h2>How it Works</h2>
									<p>Stovetop spectrometry is possible with the all-new portable mass spectrometer with high-resolution 
										and a quick learning experience. The instrument itself is composed of a laser desorption ionization
										(LDI) source that is followed by an orbitrap mass spectrometer and finally an electron multiplier 
										for a detector. All of these components have been fit into a “suitcase” form and can be transferred 
										from one restaurant to another if need be. Once the suitcase has reached its destination of use, 
										the handler can open the case and the main sampling arm can then be unfolded and locked into place. 
										This is the same for the feet of the instrument which are also adjustable to fit sturdily onto any 
										stovetop. After the instrument is in a comfortable position the cooking can start underneath the sampling 
										arm and the arm can be lowered or raised for a comfortable positioning for cooking.</p>
									<p>Before cooking can start the instrument will have to be calibrated, to do this press the calibration button on the 
										screen and it will have you place three different calibration foods (sold separately). Once that is done the 
										play button can be pressed and cooking may begin. Every thirty seconds the LDI will sample the food until the 
										cooking process is completed. This information will be stored in the instrument for the customer's interest and 
										will be sent off to the USFDA.</p>
</p>

									<h2>Who Benefits</h2>
									<p>Every restaurant that has struggled with contamination issues from time to time will feel as though the Stovetop Spectrometer
										is a lifesaver. If it were not for the stovetop spectrometer then hundreds of thousands of restaurants would be 
										put out of business. This has now been avoided by working closely with the USFDA and for businesses to not 
										have to send off samples at an expensive rate. If you or a loved one is struggling with contamination issues 
										then Stovetop Spectrometry is right for you!</p>
